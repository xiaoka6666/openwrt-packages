# Project Update Announcement: Sing-box Support Introduced Starting from Version 1.1.33
---
## We are pleased to announce that starting from version 1.1.33, the project has fully integrated support for Sing-box. Sing-box requires collaboration with firewall management features, specifically firewall4 + nftables. This update significantly enhances the system's flexibility and security, allowing users to exercise more precise control over traffic management policies.

- Sing-box Support: Sing-box has been integrated and requires the use of firewall4 + nftables, offering you a smarter and more efficient traffic management solution.
- Introducing an intelligent conversion template to completely solve the configuration difficulties of Sing-box. Our goal is to enable zero-threshold use of Sing-box.

## It is important to note that although this version greatly enhances system capabilities, the original Mihomo-related features remain unchanged, ensuring that users can continue to enjoy a stable service experience.
